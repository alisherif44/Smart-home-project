# 🏠 Smart Home Automation System

This project demonstrates a **Smart Home Automation System** using an **ATmega32 microcontroller**, designed and simulated in **Proteus** and programmed using **AVR (C/C++) in Eclipse IDE**.

---

## 🔧 Features

This system integrates multiple home automation features into one cohesive design, including:

- ✅ **LCD Display**  
  Shows system messages, temperature, and alerts.

- ✅ **Keypad (4x4)**  
  Used for secure password login to access home features.

- ✅ **Virtual Terminal**  
  Simulates mobile interface for communication.

- ✅ **Servo Motor (Door Control)**  
  Controls door opening and closing.

- ✅ **DC Motor (Water Pump)**  
  Controls water pump based on need or command.

- ✅ **Air Conditioning System**  
  - LM35 temperature sensor monitors room temperature.  
  - DC motor controlled via H-Bridge (L293D) simulates the air conditioner.

- ✅ **Flame Sensor**  
  Detects fire and triggers buzzer alarm.

- ✅ **Buzzer Alarm**  
  Sounds when flame is detected or in case of unauthorized access.

- ✅ **Dimmer Circuit**  
  Controls brightness of LED/lamp using a potentiometer.

- ✅ **EEPROM (External)**  
  Stores user data or system configuration.

- ✅ **5 Lamp Control**  
  Five individual LEDs simulate lighting system, controlled independently.
